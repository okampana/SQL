# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

## CREATING TABLE ##
CREATE TABLE Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#1 What is the average danceability by artist and track?
SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability) AS avg_Danceability 
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg_danceability DESC

#2 Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, MAX(popularity)
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10

#3 Who are the top 3 artist with the most popular track and their average popularity?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_name) AS track_count, AVG(popularity)
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY track_count DESC
LIMIT 3

#4 What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 5

#5 What's the average energy for the 10 most popular songs?
